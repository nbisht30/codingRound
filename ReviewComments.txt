Review comments and additions:-

1. Earlier only test scripts existed without the use of page objects hence updated the code using Page Object Model along with Page Factory
hence making to code easy to understand, reusable and maintainable in further stages of framework development.

2. Added a base class havings a setup() to initialize WebDriver, setting ChromeOptions to accept browser notifications
Added a loadURL() to load any generic url.
Added a tearDown() to close all tests after execution.

3. Added the latest ChromeDriver.exe for latest Chrome support as certain methods like sendKeys() did not work with latest Chrome(73.0)

4. Added testng.xml file for running all tests together.
